# Responsive Email Build Setup


#### Get Started:

`npm install`

`gulp`


#### TODO:

- configure 'send' task to retrieve html from ./build/index.html before sending email (via a promise most likely)

#### Build and Test:

`gulp build` to inline css, add media queries to the head, and send email

`gulp send` to send html template in an email without building
